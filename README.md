## Goal

- Create a simple calendar using vanilla javscript and css. No JavaScript or CSS libraries. 

## About 

### Module Pattern

- Used the module pattern to create a simple reusable function. 
- Additional functions can be added to the main function at a later time for more functionality as the project progresses.   

### Live Version 

- The live version of the calendar can be found on my website at https://chrisshimmin.com/portfolio/calendar/
